# dispRity

**dispRity** is a `R` package for summarising ordinated matrices (e.g. MDS, PCA, PCO or PCoA analysis).

### WARNING!

This is a really messy and broken developement branch used mainly for testing major architecture changes! If you don't want to wreck your package version (and potential your `R` session) and neither make your eyes bleed and highly increase your frustration levels, please refer to the peacefull [released branch](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/tree/release) or the exiting piping hot [master branch](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity).

You've been warned...

````r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("TGuillerme/dispRity", ref = "dev-testing")
library(dispRity)
