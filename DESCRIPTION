Description: this is a modular package for calculating disparity in R. Disparity can be
	calculated from any ordinated matrix. The package provides a set of implemented
	metrics to measure the ordinated space and allows users to provide and test their own
	metrics. The package also provides functions for looking at disparity serially
	(e.g. time series) and for visualising the results. Finally, this package provides
	several basic statistical tests commonly used in disparity analyses.
