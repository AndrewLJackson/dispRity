Description: this is a modulable package for calculating disparity in R. Disparity can be
	calculated from any ordinated matrix. The package provides a set of implemented metrics
	to measure the ordinated space and allows users to provide and test their own metrics
	(please share them!). The package also provides functions for looking at disparity in
	a serial way (e.g. time series) as well as visualising the results. Finally, this
	package provides several basic statistical test for disparity analysis.
