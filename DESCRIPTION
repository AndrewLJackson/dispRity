Description: this is a modular package for calculating disparity in R. Disparity can be
	calculated from any ordinated matrix. The package provides a set of implemented
	metrics to measure the ordinated space and allows users to provide and test their own
	metrics. The package also provides functions for looking at disparity in a serial way
	(e.g. time series) as well as visualising the results. Finally, this package provides
	several basic statistical test for disparity analysis.
