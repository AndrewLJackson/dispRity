# Package wish list
* Allow disparity metrics that work on a full distribution (i.e. for then allowing to compare the observed distributions directly)
* Add a `k.root` function for scaling at the **k**th root where **k** is the number of ordination axis (useful for scaling product metrics).
* Allow more level 1 functions for metric (e.g. `metric = c(k.root, prod, variances)`).
